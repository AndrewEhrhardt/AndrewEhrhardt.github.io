    <div class="info">
      <p> I graduated from Gustavus Adolphus College in 2017 with a degree in psychology. My interest in mental health led me to pursue a role at Cigna Behavioral Health to work directly with individuals experiencing mental health concerns. Much of my time was spent helping individuals navigate confusing and unintuitive websites to find mental health providers. It was at this time I realized my interest in web design and coding. </p>

     <h5> Behavioral Advocacy - Eden Prairie (March 2018 - July 2019) </h5>
     
   </div>
     
   <div class="info">
     <p> During my time as a personal advocate I worked hard to learn as much as I can and sharpen my interpersonal skills when working with customers. I became proficient in a variety of complicated internal programs that were used to document and assist individuals experiencing mental health crises. I was a fast and efficient worker and consistently completed a significant amount of work when compared to my peers. My accomplishments were recognized and I was able to be further trained on doing claims work. This involved a lot of problem solving and thinking outside the box, while still prioritizing quickness and good customer service. </p>

     <h5> Care Coordinator - Eden Prairie, MN (July 2019 - May 2021) </h5>
     
   </div>
   
   <p> As a result of my proficiency in the personal advocate role, I was able to transition and gain more experience in a new role as a Care Coordinator. As a Care Coordinator I had a large number of responsibilities including assisting in locating behavioral health providers for companies after a traumatic event, finding beds for individuals experiencing drug and or mental health crises, completing authorizations for both inpatient and outpatient visits, finding outpatient appointments for members and doing audits to ensure work was being documented correctly. </p>
